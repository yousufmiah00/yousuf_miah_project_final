Project Title: Computer Science Project Grading System
Languages Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
--------------------------
Project Description:
--------------------------
This is a web-based grading system for evaluating group presentations.
Judges can log in, assign scores to project criteria, and submit grades.
An admin can log in separately to view all submitted grades and group averages.

No backend or database is used — all data is stored using browser localStorage.


* I have submitted Public link in project report and submission box in brightspace.


how to use :

This project starts from home.html, which provides two options: Judge Login and Admin Login. A judge can log in, submit grades using the form, and the data is saved in the browser’s localStorage. After submission, you can go back to home.html and check the Admin Login to view all submitted grades and group averages. Both judge and admin actions must be done in the same browser to display results correctly.
